			  The OUnit library

Overview

  OUnit is a unit testing framework for Objective Caml, inspired by
  the JUnit tool for Java, and the HUnit tool for Haskell. OUnit is
  free software; see its "LICENCE" file for details.  OUnit is
  available at <http://home.wanadoo.nl/maas/ocaml>.

Installation

  - Edit the variable at the beginning of the Makefile. The defaults
    are ok for Linux.

  - Do "make all"

  - If the Objective Caml native-code compiler is available on your
    platform (look for the "ocamlopt" executable), do "make allopt".

  - To generate the documentation, do "make doc"

  - (Optional) To test the library, do "make test"

  - (Optional) To test the library compiled with ocamlopt and ocamlc,
    do "make testall"

  - Become super-user if necessary and do "make install".  This
    installs the library in the standard Objective Caml library
    directory.
